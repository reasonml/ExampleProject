# Reason via `yarn`

Example project using Reason as an `yarn` dependency.

(For instructions with npm, see [Reason via npm](https://github.com/reasonml/ExampleProject/blob/master/README-NPM.md))

## Install yarn:

[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a fast, reliable, and secure dependency management tool. You can now use yarn to install reason and manage its dependencies.

```
npm install -g yarn
```

## Get started:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/reasonml/ExampleProject.git
cd ExampleProject
yarn cache clean # need to clean every time before installation, see https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/480
yarn install
yarn reasonbuild
yarn start
```

## Included Top Level

The top level `rtop` is built in to the sandbox:

```sh
# Opens `rtop` from the sandbox.
yarn top

```

# Editor Support

All of the IDE support, including error highlighting, autocomplete, and
syntax is included inside of the sandbox.

```sh
# Opens your `$EDITOR` with all the right tools in your `$PATH`
yarn editor
```
or
```sh
# Opens your `$EDITOR` with all the right tools in your `$PATH`
npm run editor
```

To make your editor load the IDE support from the sandbox:

- Make sure your `$EDITOR` variable is set if not already.
  - `export EDITOR=vim`, or `export EDITOR=atom`
- Configure your `EDITOR` to load the `Reason` plugins. See the instructions
  for [Atom](http://facebook.github.io/reason/tools.html#merlin-atom) and
  [Vim](https://github.com/facebook/reason/tree/master/editorSupport/VimReason).

> Note: If you use `atom`, and already have `opam` installed, then there's a
known issue where `atom` has problems loading, but you can fix it easily
by commenting out any part in your `bashrc` that sources opam environments.
We will come up with a long term solution at some point.


### What's happening
- `npm install` / `yarn install` will download and install all your dependencies, and run the
  `postinstall` steps for all of those dependencies, and then finally the
  `postinstall` script step of this project.
- `npm start` / `yarn start` will run the script located in the `start` field of the
  `scripts` section of the `package.json` file here. The `start` script simply
  runs the binary that was built in the `postinstall` step.
- No, really - all you need is `npm` (> `3.0`) or yarn. All of the compiler infrastructure
  has been organized into `npm` packages, and will be compiled on your host
  inside of the `./node_modules` directory. No `PATH`s are poluted. No global
  environment variables destroyed. No trace is left on your system. If you
  delete the `./node_modules` directory, you're back to exactly where you
  started.


### How to customize
- `npm` / `yarn` allows `scripts` to be specified in your project's `package.json`.
  These `scripts` are a named set of commands.
- A few scripts have special meaning, such as the `postinstall` script. The
  `postinstall` script is how your project compiles itself. It is guaranteed
  that the `postinstall` script executes any time you run `npm install` / `yarn install` in this
  package, or any time another package installs you as a dependency. You're
  also guaranteed that your `postinstall` script is executed *after* all of
  your dependencies' `postinstall` scripts.
- You can add new named scripts in the `package.json` `scripts` field. Once
  added, you can then run them via `npm run scriptName` from within the project
  root.
- `. dependencyEnv` is commonly used in these `scripts`. The dot `.` sources
  `dependencyEnv` which manages the environment, and ensure that important
  binaries (such as `refmt`) are in the `PATH`. `dependencyEnv` ensures that
  the environment is augmented only for the duration of that `script` running,
  and only in ways that you or your immediate dependencies decide. When
  the entire purpose of developer tools is to generate a binary (such as a
  compiler) to be included in your `PATH`, or produce a library whose path
  should be specified in an special environment variable, it's almost like the
  environment variable is the public API of that package. `dependencyEnv`
  allows your script to see the environment variables that your immediate
  dependencies wanted to publish as their public API. You can learn how
  packages can publish environment variables in the [dependency-env
  repo](https://github.com/npm-ml/dependency-env).

### Recompiling
- To recompile this package (but not your dependencies), remove the local build
  artifacts for this package (usually just the `_build` directory) and then run
  `yarn postinstall` or `npm run postinstall`.

### How to turn this project into a library

- To turn this example project into a library that other people can depend on
  via `npm`... (coming soon).

### Troubleshooting:
- Check to make sure everything is installed correctly. There's a `script`
  already setup that will help you test the location of where `Reason` has been
  compiled into.

```
npm run whereisreason
```


- If something goes wrong, try deleting the local `node_modules` directory that
  was installed, and then try reinstalling using `npm install -f`.

- For yarn, also delete `~/.yarn` and `./yarn.lock` to remove build cache.

### TODO:

- This also installs sandboxed IDE support for Vim/Atom/Emacs. We need to
  upgrade all of the plugins to automatically search for IDE plugins inside of
  the `./node_modules` directory.
